# 0x03-hyperparameter_tuning

## What is Hyperparameter Tuning?

> Hyperparameter tuning is an essential part of controlling the behavior of a machine learning model. If we don’t correctly tune our hyperparameters, our estimated model parameters produce suboptimal results, as they don’t minimize the loss function. This means our model makes more errors. In practice, key indicators like the accuracy or the confusion matrix will be worse.
> 
> Hyperparameter tuning consists of finding a set of optimal hyperparameter values for a learning algorithm while applying this optimized algorithm to any data set. That combination of hyperparameters maximizes the model’s performance, minimizing a predefined loss function to produce better results with fewer errors.

## What are Hyperparameters?

> Hyperparameters are specific to the algorithm itself, so we can’t calculate their values from the data. We use hyperparameters to calculate the model parameters. Different hyperparameter values produce different model parameter values for a given data set.
