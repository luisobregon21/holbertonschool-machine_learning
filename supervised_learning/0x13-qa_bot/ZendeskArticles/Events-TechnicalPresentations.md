Events - Technical presentations
The format of a technical presentation is largely up to the industry professional presenter. Typically the presenter will occupy most of the presentation with a talk, which may or may not be followed by a participatory tutorial. Presentations are typically followed by 10-20 minutes of Q and A. As mentioned above, technical presentations are a unique opportunity for students to hear information they may otherwise miss out on. Each presenter will offer a unique perspective and history that cannot be matched by any amount of coursework or reading. Students should take the opportunity to take a break from whatever project they are working on and participate.
