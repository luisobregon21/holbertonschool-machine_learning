Transfers Overview
There are two scenarios in which a student may be transferred. These transfers are at the discretion of the Institution Representative:
A student may request to be transferred to the next cohort due to academic, financial, personal, or other reasons. 
A student is recommended by the Curriculum Team to be transferred to the next cohort due to scores and would restart their trimester. If students are transferred during the 30-day Trial Period, they will be asked to sign a new Enrollment Agreement and will begin a new 30-day Trial Period once they restart the program with their new cohort. 
Process
The student and staff will discuss via email or in-person meeting the transfer request/suggestion and the decision will be made whether to transfer soon afterward. Once the transfer is approved by both parties the transfer paperwork will be sent to the student via DocuSign to confirm:
The studentâ€™s start date and updated graduation date
The requirements to start with a new cohort
