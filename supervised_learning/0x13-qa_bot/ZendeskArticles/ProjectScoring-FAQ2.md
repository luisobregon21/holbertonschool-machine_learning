Project Scoring FAQ
“I was unable to complete the project by the second deadline due to circumstances outside my control. How can I get my project graded?”
Please reach out to your Student Success Manager or Software Engineer to discuss the possibility of a regrade of your project.
"My project grade is not the same as at the top of the project page. It says I’m X% done!"
The percentage done is not your project grade, but merely an indication of how many tasks you have completed. Remember, it is possible to finish all project tasks and get a grade below 200% with 65%/50% regrades. Your project grade is located in the “In a nutshell” section.
"I clicked for a new grade, but my score hasn’t changed. What’s up?"
Wait a few minutes for the correction to be processed and try refreshing the page. If the score still does not update after 15 minutes, please post about your issue in the checker_issues slack channel.
"My score from last trimester went down, what happened?"
If you have recently asked for a new correction for a project that was from the previous trimester and your score for that project went down (as is possible with regrades), it would be reflected in your trimester score.
