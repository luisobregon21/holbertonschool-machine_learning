Curriculum FAQ
"Sometimes I spend hours making headway on the projects; why won’t you make them easier?"
Again, we know this can feel really tough, and we want to ensure you know YOU ARE NOT ALONE. You have peers across the world, prior cohorts who have been there, and lots of staff and HBTN allies that have your back. 
Learning things in this way - where you need to work hard for answers and grapple with content - will help you deeply integrate the content. 
"Why do I have to ask for help?"
We know this can be really hard to do, especially if you’re an introvert, independent, or unaccustomed to asking strangers for project insight : ) This is an invaluable skill, though, for which companies are willing to compensate.
If a manager knows that you have a great balance and understanding of when to wrestle with a challenge versus when to reach out to others for resolution, they will be able to trust you with valuable company time and money. 
Not to mention, learning to ask for help expedites problem-solving, can increase confidence, facilitates collaboration, and helps develop empathy.
