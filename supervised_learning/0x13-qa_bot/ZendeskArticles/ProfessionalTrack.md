Professional Track Overview
In your career, your professionalism will be equally as important as your actual engineering abilities. We want to make sure that our students leave school not only with great technical skills, but also the professional skills to help them throughout their careers.  
Each trimester, the students are given a baseline Professional Track score of 100%. Just as an employee’s professionalism can negatively impact their career trajectory, the professionalism score acts as a weight on a student’s overall average. The track score will either increase or decrease based on a student's fulfillment and observance of varying community expectations. 
Examples of increase/decrease:
The Professional Track score can increase when community service is accomplished including:
Completing stand up presentations
Running meetups
Successfully performing officer duties 
The professional score can decrease for the following reasons:
Failure to meet community responsibilities such as officer duties, stand up presentations, meet up obligations, etc.
Failure to attend RSVP’d event
Cheating
Disrespectful behavior to staff, peers, or others
Repeated tardiness or absences
The professional score acts as a weight on a student's overall score.
