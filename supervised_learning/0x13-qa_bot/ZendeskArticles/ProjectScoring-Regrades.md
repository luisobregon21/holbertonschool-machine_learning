Project Scoring - Regrades
Each project has two deadlines. The first deadline is the main project deadline, which is graded as mentioned above. The second deadline is a chance for students to go back over their Auto QA portion of their projects and correct their mistakes after conferring with peers. Tasks that were not fully completed will be regraded at 65%. What does that mean? For each task that was not 100% finished, all of its checks will be rechecked. If a check was already passing and is still passing, it will receive the same point value as previously.  If a check is newly passing, it will receive 65% of the points. If a check is no longer passing, it will receive 0 points. After the second deadline, all tasks (Auto and Manual QA) can be re-graded at 50% by clicking on the red “Ask a new correction” button. Students should be careful as regrades can lower their scores!
