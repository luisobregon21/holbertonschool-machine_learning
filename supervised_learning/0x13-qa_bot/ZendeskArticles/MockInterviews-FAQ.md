Mock Interview FAQ
“My interviewer scores me more strictly than the other interviewers score their interviewees. Can’t we make this more standardized?”
Each student is entrusted to score fairly, and support their interviewee with hints if they are stuck (which would result in a point deduction). We understand that there may be a variance between how interviewers score, but this is also what it will be in the real world.
“I thought the mock interview was x minutes long, but I only got y?”
This oftentimes happens in situations where mock interview topics are finished early. Although a
mock interview has a designated length, each mock interview topic also has its own designated length.
You do not accumulate time from finishing mock interview topics early.
“If my interviewer is late do I suffer?”
If your interviewer is 5 mins late you both will swap places and you will become the interviewer, and you will be the interviewee later on in the day.
“The question is very long! I can’t possibly read off all this content to which the interviewee will understand it!”
This is a valid point. In cases where a question may have a lot of content, we trust the interviewer to use their judgment in displaying aspects of the question. If you do decide to share the display with the interviewee make sure you toggle hide for the answer.
