Purpose
This guide is to assist your transition from working on campus to working from home. 
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it has been advised we participate in social distancing to mitigate the spread of this virus. Fortunately, Holberton is able to continue with operations remotely, to ensure the health and safety of our students and communities. 
This transition period will pose different challenges for us all and our hope for this guide is to provide you with ways to make this transition smoother. 
Routine
Creating a routine that works best for you and sticking with it is going to be most helpful to you. You want to do your best to treat everyday that you work from home as you would working on campus, with the necessary adjustments. 
This includes making sure to wake up at a decent hour and get dressed, which will help put you in the mindset to get started on your work. Having a schedule will greatly help you establish a routine. (Please review the section on Time Management for more direction).
Make sure your schedule includes the following:
The time your day begins. 
The things youâ€™ll need to complete for the day, including homework, chores, and errands.
Breaks for rejuvenation and rest.
When the workday is over.
