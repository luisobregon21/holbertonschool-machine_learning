Project Scoring - Grades
Each project has a weight, which can be found in the top left corner of the project page. This weight acts as the number of times the project score gets counted towards the studentâ€™s overall grade. Most projects have a weight of 1, but larger projects (like printf, shell, etc.) will have a higher weight. 
Example: If you completed 5 projects at 100%, each with a project weight of 1, and 1 project at 50% with a project weight of 5, your grade would be calculated as follows:
Grade = (100% + 100% + 100% + 100% + 100% + 5*50%) / (1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 5) = 75%
