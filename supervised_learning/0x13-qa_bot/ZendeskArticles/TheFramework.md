Overview
Often times, when people hear of a school without professors or lectures, they question if the experience is pure chaos; to the contrary, peer learning facilitated by Holberton’s learning methodology - referred to as The Framework - creates a safe, collaborative space where critical thinking, personal growth, and community development can thrive.
The Holberton learning methodology subscribes to a balance of self-efficacy and collaboration - the truth that we, indeed, go farther when we go together. A community will be as strong as those within it that are struggling, so each individual has a responsibility to themselves and their future to take full ownership of their success as well as the work it requires. That said, once they’ve exhausted those means of achieving understanding and success alone, they must reach out to others who in turn will respectfully acknowledge the work that that individual invested prior to asking for help.

The 0x0C steps of the Framework are as follows:
0. Read
1. Think
2. Think more and Whiteboard
3. Ask why?
4. Read the error messages
5. Google
6. Google again
7. Ask a peer
8. Ask more peers
9. Ask your TA
10. Ask other TAs
11. Ask Staff/Alumni/Professional
