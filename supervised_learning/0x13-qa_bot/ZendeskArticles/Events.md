Events Overview
On-site events are a very important part of the Holberton experience. They can be an opportunity for working on exciting, fast-paced projects in hackathons, or to listen to and interact with industry professionals during fireside chats or technical presentations. They are good opportunities for the acquisition of new knowledge and common practices that will be essential to landing a job and succeeding in their new career. Students are highly encouraged to attend. There are times where they may feel too busy with projects to get “sidetracked” by an event, but each event is unique and may offer invaluable information that students may not get another opportunity to hear.
