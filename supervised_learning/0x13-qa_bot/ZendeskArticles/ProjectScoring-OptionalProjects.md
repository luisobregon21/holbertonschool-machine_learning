Project Scoring - Optional Projects
There are some projects throughout the curriculum that are not mandatory. These projects are for students who have already completed the mandatory projects and are looking to further their knowledge base. Because optional projects only contain advanced tasks, the project scoring starts at 100% and goes to 200%. Completing any part of these types of projects will, therefore, lead to a score above 100%. Optional projects will only count towards a student’s overall grade if they receive a score above 100%. It is possible for an optional project to lower a student’s grade if their overall average is higher than their project grade.
