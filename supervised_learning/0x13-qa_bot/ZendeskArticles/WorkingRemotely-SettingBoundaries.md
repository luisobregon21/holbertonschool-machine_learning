Setting Boundaries
At this time, many people have been asked to make the transition to work from home and so you may find yourself having to share your day with roommates, children or family. It’s natural that those you live with will want to connect and spend time with you now that you are home and it would be best to establish boundaries with them early on if possible. This is to ensure your environment is conducive to productivity. You should share with your housemates your work hours, and more specifically any times in particular you’ll need a quiet space for meetings or video chat sessions.  
Those with children will face many challenges as they will need to be homeschooled as well. If your child is old enough that they don’t need to be constantly supervised, work in a different room from where they will be stationed. For those whose children are too young to be unsupervised for long periods of time, you can try setting up a workstation for them near you. The hope here is that the child will follow your example by also quietly doing work. Aside from providing your child with books, games, arts & crafts projects, there are many online resources to help keep children occupied.
