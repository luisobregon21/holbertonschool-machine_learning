Project Scoring - Contribution
For team projects, a team contribution score will be determined based on the number of commits and lines added/deleted by each teammate. Contribution scores start at 100%. If there is a large discrepancy between teammate contribution, the contribution grade will be reduced. This score will then act as a weight on the overall project grade.
Example: You and your teammates earned a mandatory score of 95% and an advanced score of 80%. Unfortunately, one of your teammates contributed significantly less than the others, causing your contribution score to drop to 50%. Your overall score would be calculated as follows:
Overall Score = Contribution Score * (Mandatory Score + (Mandatory Score * Advanced Score))Overall Score = 50% * (95% + (95% * 80%)) = 85.5%
