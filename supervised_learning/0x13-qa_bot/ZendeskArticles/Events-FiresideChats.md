Events - Fireside chats
Fireside chats typically entail an interview of an industry professional by one or two Holberton students, followed by a round of Q and A. Students who volunteer to run the interview have the opportunity to develop a list of questions relevant to the interviewee’s experience. This is excellent practice both in self-direction and public speaking. The interview portion should occupy roughly half of the total fireside chat. The Q and A portion can be managed either by the student interviewers or the interviewee, depending on the interviewee’s preference. All fireside chats should be recorded and broadcast to other campuses as a means to share the opportunity with everyone.
