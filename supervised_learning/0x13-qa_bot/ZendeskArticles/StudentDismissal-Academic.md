Dismissal - Academic Probation/Scores
A student must maintain a minimum Global Score of 80% per trimester to be in good academic standing. WIthin each trimester there are three months, and if a student is below 80% in one month they will be placed on academic probation. If at the end of the Trimester, the student has not raised their Global Score to the 80% minimum, they will be dismissed or they may be offered the opportunity to be transferred to a new cohort, to repeat their trimester. This decision is made at the sole discretion of the Institution Representative. 

Dismissal - Academic Dishonesty/Cheating
If a student is caught cheating or being academically dishonest they could receive a one-time warning prior to dismissal, or they could be immediately dismissed. This is dependent upon the nature and severity of the academic dishonesty, and/or at the discretion of the Institution Representative.
