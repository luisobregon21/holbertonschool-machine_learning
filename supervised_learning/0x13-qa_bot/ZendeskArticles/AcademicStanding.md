Holberton strives to be a supportive learning space with clear expectations. This is an intense program and in order to maintain an equitable and cooperative space, you need to know of the protocol and resources surrounding your performance.
The academic score at Holberton is monitored throughout the year with benchmarks set at the midnight between Sunday and Monday local time after each trimester end. In other words, the hardline expectation of performance is at the 3 month, 6 month, and 9 month marks of your Foundations and Specialization years. This composite score is an average between each track of the curriculum - social, technical tracks, and professionalism.
Although some of these tracks aren’t technical in nature, they are still considered to be part of the academics of Holberton, since their utilization is inherent to our students’ success.
However, given the nature of Specializations, the tracks involved are only technical - both their chosen specialization as well as the "Interview Preparation" track.
The overall average must be 80% to progress in the program; failure to achieve this will prevent a student from progressing through the program - however, they may potentially be offered an opportunity to repeat up to one additional time per trimester.
