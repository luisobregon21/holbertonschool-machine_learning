Professional Advisors FAQ
"How can I create opportunities for myself?"
First off, be aware of what you want. This applies to any step of the journey. Maybe, you want to get better at technical writing, or perhaps your long term plan is to work in cybersecurity. Whatever the case may be; if you are aware of what you want you will have ideas as to what you need. 
Once you’re aware of what you need, follow The Framework, and don’t be shy in asking for help! 
Others can only help as effectively as you define what you need. 
We want to see what you have to share, build, and create, but only you can take the first steps to actualize that. 
"How do I gain access to professional advisors?"
Please, follow The Framework. 
"How do I build a network?"
Be yourself. It may sound cliche, but if you are busy living your best life and pursuing your dreams with integrity you will draw advocates. If you are excited about Machine Learning, for example, then follow that with every moment and any spare chance you get; along the way, you will encounter those that have the information you will need to know. 
"How do I create my narrative?"
Again, know what you want. If you know what your end goal is, then you can begin to craft an authentic social media presence, self-introduction, and networking purpose that effectively shares your goals with others in an optimum way.  
If you don’t know what you want, don’t worry about a narrative just yet. Instead, focus on learning about this big world of technology, and when you’ve found the job/product/technology/industry that lights you up you’ll know what to aim for. Otherwise, you’ll be asking for investment from others in roles that you may realize you no longer want to pursue.
