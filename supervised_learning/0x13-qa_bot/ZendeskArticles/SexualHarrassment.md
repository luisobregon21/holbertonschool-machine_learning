This is a definition of our Sexual Harassment policy found in the Student Catalog (p.42 in 2020 Catalog / p.69 in 2019 Catalog):
This institution is committed to provide a work and study environment that is free of discrimination, intimidation and harassment. In keeping with this commitment, we believe that it necessary to affirmatively confront this subject and express our strong disapproval of sexual harassment. No one associated with this institution may engage in verbal abuse of a sexual nature; use sexually degrading or graphic words to describe an individual or an individual's body; or display sexually suggestive objects or pictures at any facility or other venue associated with this institution. Students are responsible for conducting themselves in a manner consistent with the spirit and intent of this policy.
We will not tolerate any type of behavior that may be associated with sexual harassment. Please reach out to a staff member if you would like to discuss the policy, or report an incident.
