Full-Time Curriculum Specialization
Students can study any of the below specializations on-campus or remotely. Similar to the Foundations Year students must meet an 80% minimum per trimester to advance to the sequential trimester.
There are three specializations from which to choose:
Machine Learning
AR/VR
Low-Level & Algorithms
Full-Stack Web Development

Specialization Validation Criteria
Once a student has procured employment, they will engage in their on-the-job training until such time they are able to provide a recommendation letter. To validate the Specialization Year with a recommendation letter a student must be either:
A full-time employee with the same company for 6 months
This includes the situation where a full-time intern/apprentice/contractor/consultant, changes their status to be a full-time employee with the same company on or after the six-month mark
A full-time apprentice with the same company for 9 months
A full-time contractor/consultant with the same company for 6 months
