Monthly, students will get an Evaluation Quiz after a PLD. If you struggle with these quizzes, it is a good indication that you need to work on reviewing these concepts. The data has shown when students comprehend below a certain threshold they donâ€™t experience success after the program; this accountability is preventative to make sure we can help students get any help they may need. Unlike Mock Interviews, these quizzes do have an effect on scores by acting as a weighted project in the section score. It is in your best interest to take these quizzes seriously and reflect afterward on what you did well and what could have gone better. Most questions are taken from mandatory project tasks and quizzes that you have already seen in the curriculum at the time you are taking the evaluation quiz. The quizzes get increasingly difficult; for example, in the first Trimester have no project tasks from the third Trimester, but the third Trimester quizzes may have tasks from the first Trimester. 
On days with Evaluation Quizzes, the Software Engineer will gather the cohort and release the quiz.  Students have 1 hour to complete the quiz with no outside help. The quiz may not be paused, but it may be completed before the hour is up.  Students may not look up concept pages, search the internet, nor discuss with peers while they complete the quiz. Students can, however, use paper and pen to organize their thoughts.
