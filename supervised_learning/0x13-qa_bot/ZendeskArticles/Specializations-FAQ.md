Specialization FAQ

"Where can I find more information on the tracks?"
Zendesk, Syllabus, and if that isn’t enough you can ask staff. 

"Why isn’t ___________ specialization offered?"
We have varying additional Specializations to be released in 2020; if you have a preference, please let us know so we can take that to heart as we iterate and prioritize! 
 
"Do I have to do it full-time?"
Yes, Specialization content is as intensive as Foundations. It requires your undivided attention. 
 
"Can I do it part-time?"
You cannot do it part-time, however, once your Specialization is fully validated and you’ve graduated from Holberton you may access all Specialization projects at any point in time at your own pace - including future content. 
 
"Can it be done remotely?"
Starting January 2020, Specializations will involve Peer Learning Days, Mock Interviews, and collaboration; if you are unable to be onsite, let us know and we'll help you explore remote participation!
 
"Can I study at another Holberton campus?"
If you want to do your full-time studies remotely while working at another Holberton campus, let us know, and we’ll see what we can do!
