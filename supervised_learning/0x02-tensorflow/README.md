# Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

## General

What is a session? graph?

What are tensors?

What are variables? constants? placeholders? How do you use them?

What are namespaces? How do you use them?

How to train a neural network in tensorflow

What is a checkpoint?

How to save/load a model with tensorflow

How to add and get variables from the collection

## Requirements

Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs

All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8)

Your files will be executed with numpy (version 1.19.2) and tensorflow (version 2.6)

All your files should end with a new line

The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env python3

A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory

Your code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.6)

All your modules should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')

All your classes should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')

All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')

Unless otherwise noted, you are not allowed to import any module except import tensorflow.compat.v1 as tf

All your files must be executable

The length of your files will be tested using wc
